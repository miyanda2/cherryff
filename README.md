# Module 1. **Computer Science.**

<br>
	
  Computer science is the study of problems, problem-solving, and the solutions that come out of the problem-solving process. Given a problem, a computer scientistâ€™s goal is to develop an algorithm, a stepby-step list of instructions for solving any instance of the problem that might arise. Algorithms are finiteprocesses that if followed will solve the problem. Algorithms are solutions.

# Module 2. **Programming.**

<br>

Programming is the process of taking an algorithm and encoding it into a notation, a programming language, so that it can be executed by a computer. Although many programming languages and many different types of computers exist, the important first step is the need to have the solution. Without an algorithm there can be no program.
  
<ol>
<li>algorithm</li>
<li>loops</li>
<li>variable</li>
<li>function</li>
<li>conditional</li>
<li>strings</li>
<li>if statement</li>
<li>list</li>
<li>for and in
<li>Range</li>
<li>while loop</li>
	
# Module 3. **Object Oriented Programming.**

<br>
  
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. Historically, a program has been viewed as a logical procedure that takes input data, processes it, and produces output data.

## OOP Concepts
<ol>
<li>classes</li>
<li>object</li>
<li>instances</li>
<li>Encapsulation of Data</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
<li>constructors</li>
	

### Module 4. **Data Structure.**

<br>

Data Structure is a way of collecting and organising data in such a way that we can perform operations on these data in an effective way. Data Structures is about rendering data elements in terms of some relationship, for better organization and storage.

# Basic types of Data Structures

<br>

As we discussed above, anything that can store data can be called as a data strucure, hence Integer, Float, Boolean, Char etc, all are data structures.
They are known as Primitive Data Structures.
Then we also have some complex Data Structures, which are used to store large and connected data. Some example of Abstract Data Structure are:

<ol>
<li>Linked List</li>
<li>Tree</li>
<li>Graph</li>
<li>Stack, Queue etc.</li>
